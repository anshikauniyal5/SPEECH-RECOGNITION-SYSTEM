#This circuit demonstrates a smart home setup using an ESP32 microcontroller, where an LED is connected to GPIO pin 23 and controlled via a relay. The ESP32 is programmed using libraries such as WiFi.h and SinricPro.h, enabling it to connect to a WiFi network and communicate with the Sinric Pro cloud service. Once configured, the ESP32 listens for commands from Sinric Pro to toggle the LED on or off. The LED is physically wired to the ESP32 with a green wire for signal and a blue wire for ground, representing a simple yet effective output device.
By integrating Google Home with Sinric Pro, this setup allows voice control of the LED through Google Assistant. For example, saying “Hey Google, turn on the light” sends a command from Google Home to Sinric Pro, which then relays it to the ESP32, activating the LED. This seamless interaction between cloud services and microcontroller hardware showcases the power of IoT in creating responsive and intelligent home automation systems.
